Multiple Disease Prediction Machine Learning Project
This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of three diseases: Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Diabetes based on various health metrics.

Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts used to train and evaluate machine learning models for disease prediction. The project focuses on creating predictive models for three diseases using different datasets and machine learning techniques.

Features
Heart Disease Prediction: Predicts the probability of heart disease based on features such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.
Parkinson's Disease Prediction: Assesses the risk of Parkinson's disease using relevant diagnostic indicators derived from clinical data.
Diabetes Prediction: Estimates the likelihood of diabetes occurrence based on parameters like glucose levels, BMI, etc.


Technologies and Tools Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Tools: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn,pickle
Development Environments: Jupyter Notebook, Spyder
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
